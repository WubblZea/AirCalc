
Aircalc is a tool designed to find the area of a room and the cost of fitting flooring.

The main class is currently BuilderFrame which can be automatically compiled and ran by Run.sh (or Run.bat on Windows). The file "run" is also a shell script for linux but however does not perform the compilation.

Full jar builds are not yet available and will be available once the program is final.

**NOTE**: This has been built as a A-Level computer science project and I would personally not use it in production without caution and extensive testing.
